# This is the password that will be used for PBKDF
Given I have a 'string' named 'theBackendPassword'

# Loading the data that the user is entering at the signup. This data will be sent from the client to the server
Given I have a 'base64' named 'userData'

# The server creates a PBKDF of the 'userData'
When I create the key derivation of 'userData' with password 'theBackendPassword'

# Here we print the PBKDF
Then print the 'key derivation'
